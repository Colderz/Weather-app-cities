"**Weather Untitled App**" app is a simple application presenting weather statistics from JSON data. Apart from the required methods of listing the required data in the console, it displays themin a more intuitive and user-friendly way. Displaying selected data in the form of a list is done through the recyclerView implementation with an adequate adapter. Inspired by popular weather services, I decided to clearly show the lowest and highest temperature in a single card. I also considered listing each temperature separately and it was a simple task, but it disturbed the clarity of the card. The developed application design is complemented by a personalized application icon and a splash screen in a similar style. The project also includes a set of developed unit tests for each of the methods in the main viewModel and was prepared for injection with Dagger-Hilt.
